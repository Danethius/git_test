Hello world!
The main commands in the Basic Git Workflow are as follows:
1. type git status to show files that are modified and staged (not committed).
2. type git add filename to add files to the staging area.
    staged files are green in the staging area, modified files are red.
3. type git commit --m "add filename" to commit the files 
4. type git log to show a history of changes to your code. 
NOTE: You have to save you changes with cmd+S or another method before adding files to the staging area or they will just show as committed, not modified.
